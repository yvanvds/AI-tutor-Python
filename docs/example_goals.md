This document shows example goals the students must reach. Descriptions are used to 
inform the student with more details. Suggestions will be send to the AI tutor to adjust behaviour.

## üß≠ Goal 1: Be able to write and understand very basic Python scripts

### Description

You can write and understand short Python scripts that use `print()`, variables, and basic mathematical operators. You understand how these building blocks interact to produce simple outputs.

---

### Subgoal 1: Use `print()` correctly

#### Description

You can display text or numbers on screen with the `print()` function and understand when to use quotes around text versus numbers.

#### Suggestions

* Begin with examples and let students predict what each line will print.
* Ask them to explain why certain lines cause errors (e.g. missing quotes).
* Follow up with short tasks where they must write the `print()` statements themselves.

---

### Subgoal 2: Work with variables

#### Description

You can create and use variables to store values, and you understand the difference between text (`str`), integers (`int`), and real numbers (`float`).

#### Suggestions

* Use simple examples to show how variable values can change during execution.
* Contrast code that uses `"5"` (a string) and `5` (a number) and discuss what happens.
* Provide small exercises where students must fix or complete snippets with incorrect variable usage.

---

### Subgoal 3: Apply basic mathematical operators

#### Description

You can use Python‚Äôs basic mathematical operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `//`, `%`) and understand how they behave with different types of numbers.

#### Suggestions

* Start with `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, then introduce `**`, `//`, and `%` once the basics are secure.
* Let students predict the result before running each expression.
* Include examples that mix integers and floats, and demonstrate what happens when math operators are used with strings.

## üß≠ Goal 2: Be able to write and understand conditional statements

### Description

You can write and understand Python programs that make decisions using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. You know how comparison and logical operators control program flow.

---

### Subgoal 1: Understand comparison operators

#### Description

You can compare values using operators such as `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`, and predict whether an expression is `True` or `False`.

#### Suggestions

* Present short examples and have students state which lines evaluate to `True`.
* Use real-life contexts (‚ÄúIs temperature > 30?‚Äù) to make the logic meaningful.
* Follow up with small prediction tasks before moving to coding exercises.

---

### Subgoal 2: Use `if` and `else` statements

#### Description

You can write simple conditional statements that execute different code depending on whether a condition is true or false.

#### Suggestions

* Start from natural-language examples (‚ÄúIf it rains, take an umbrella.‚Äù).
* Let students convert such sentences into code step by step.
* Gradually increase complexity by nesting or combining conditions.

---

### Subgoal 3: Use `elif` and combine conditions logically

#### Description

You can chain multiple conditions with `elif` and use logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to combine them.

#### Suggestions

* Show how `elif` avoids redundant `if` statements.
* Practice truth tables for `and` / `or` / `not` to clarify outcomes.
* Design mini-projects like a grade classifier (‚ÄúIf score >= 90: ‚Ä¶ elif score >= 80: ‚Ä¶ else: ‚Ä¶‚Äù).
